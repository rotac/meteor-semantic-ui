##Install
Put following record into smart.json and run 'mrt update'
```javascript
{
  "packages": {
    "router": {},
    "semantic-ui": {"git": "https://github.com/rotac/meteor-semantic-ui"}
  }
}
```

###issues:
Javascript elements like dropdowns should be active by default. At the moment you can activate them in the template.rendered function like: 

```javascript
Template.hello.rendered = function(){
	$('.ui.dropdown').dropdown();
}
```
